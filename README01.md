### ðŸ§© Pattern List

| File Name | Output | Description |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| pattern1.cpp | ******<br>*****<br>*****<br>*****<br>***** | Rectangle of stars (rows Ã— columns). Uses two nested loops for printing stars. |
| pattern2.cpp | *<br>**<br>***<br>****<br>***** | Right-angled triangle of stars. Each row prints `i` stars. |
| pattern3.cpp | 1<br>12<br>123<br>1234<br>12345 | Increasing number triangle. Each row prints numbers from 1 to i. |
| pattern4.cpp | 1<br>22<br>333<br>4444<br>55555 | Number pattern where the row number is repeated `i` times. |
| pattern5.cpp | *****<br>****<br>***<br>**<br>* | Inverted triangle of stars. Starts with n stars and decreases each row. |
| pattern6.cpp | 12345<br>1234<br>123<br>12<br>1 | Inverted number triangle. Prints numbers from 1 to decreasing limit. |
